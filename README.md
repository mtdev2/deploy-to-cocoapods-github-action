# Deploy to cocoapods

Using this GitHub Action, you can deploy automatically your pod library to [Cocoapods.org](https://cocoapods.org)

## Requirements

- Must have register to cocoapod trunk. Please refer to [Getting setup with Trunk](https://guides.cocoapods.org/making/getting-setup-with-trunk.html) on how to register.
- Get your `trunk token` by using `pod trunk me --verbose` from your command line.

  Example response:

  ```bash
  opening connection to trunk.cocoapods.org:443...
  opened
  starting SSL for trunk.cocoapods.org:443...
  SSL established, protocol: TLSv1.2, cipher: ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256

  -> "\r\n"
  ```
  Please get only the `XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` as your `trunk token`.

- register the your `trunk token` as [Secrets](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) and named it as `COCOAPODS_TRUNK_TOKEN`.

## Usage

The workflow, usually declared in `.github/workflows/deploy_to_cocoapods.yml`, looks like:

```yml
name: deploy_to_cocoapods

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: macOS-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    
    - name: Install Cocoapods
      run: gem install cocoapods
    
    # shortcut version
    - uses: michaelhenry/deploy-to-cocoapods-github-action@1.0.10
      env:
        COCOAPODS_TRUNK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.COCOAPODS_TRUNK_TOKEN }}
```

OR


```yml
name: deploy_to_cocoapods

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: macOS-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    
    - name: Install Cocoapods
      run: gem install cocoapods
      
    - name: Deploy to Cocoapods
      run: |
        set -eo pipefail
        pod lib lint --allow-warnings
        pod trunk push --allow-warnings
      env:
        COCOAPODS_TRUNK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.COCOAPODS_TRUNK_TOKEN }}
```

## Example

An actual example can be found on this Repository: [Autobot](https://github.com/michaelhenry/AutoBot/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy_to_cocoapods.yml).

## Recommendations

I also do recommend to automatically sync your library versioning with your `git tags or releases`. for example this  `*.spec` file, I provided an environment variable for `LIB_VERSION` to use as the actual version, else it will goes to fallback version which is `1.0`

```ruby
Pod::Spec.new do |s|
  s.name             = 'AutoBot'
  s.version          = ENV['LIB_VERSION'] || '1.0' #fallback to major version
  s.summary          = 'UITestCases generator and executor for iOS Application.'
...
end
```

on the github action, we have to update the step `Deploy to Cocoapods` from

```yml
...
    - name: Deploy to Cocoapods
      run: |
        set -eo pipefail
        pod lib lint --allow-warnings
        pod trunk push --allow-warnings
      env:
        COCOAPODS_TRUNK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.COCOAPODS_TRUNK_TOKEN }}
```

to 

```yml
...
    - name: Deploy to Cocoapods
      run: |
        set -eo pipefail
        export LIB_VERSION=$(git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`)
        pod lib lint --allow-warnings
        pod trunk push --allow-warnings
      env:
        COCOAPODS_TRUNK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.COCOAPODS_TRUNK_TOKEN }}
```

and that's all.
